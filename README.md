# Competitive programming

My journey of trying to solve interesting competitive programming problems, just for fun

my progress is tracked in this Log-Database [Competitive Programming](https://forero-data.notion.site/Competitive-programming-2843cdefab124beebc5c471c64ccc27c?pvs=4) in Notion

update [2022 - future] 
## ONLY RULE - I will not use LLMs GPT-like, copilots or see solutions from other people

- Only solved problems here, if I am not uploading solutions that means I'm working/struggling with a new problem
