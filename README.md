# competitive-programming
My journey of trying to solve interesting competitive programming problems, just for fun

my progress is tracked in this Log-Database [Competitive Programming](https://forero-data.notion.site/Competitive-programming-2843cdefab124beebc5c471c64ccc27c?pvs=4)

this repo contains the code for my solutions. I will add references and other solution alternatives by other programmers after I found mine
